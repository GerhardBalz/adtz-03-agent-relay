# Claude Code prompts — Homework 3

Exact user prompts from the original Claude Code session, in order. The matching dialogue and tool activity are in [claude-code-conversation.md](claude-code-conversation.md).

## Coverage

| Session ID | Started (UTC) | Start directory | Included turns | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `34b15e8d-9ed7-4d89-af19-9f0705a5aa71` | 2026-09-24T12:06:05Z | `<HOME>` (home directory; the repository was cloned during this session) | Prompts 1–5 complete; prompt 6 partial | Partial — prompt 6 (record maintenance) was in progress when these files were generated |

- Sources: the original local Claude Code session transcript for `34b15e8d-9ed7-4d89-af19-9f0705a5aa71` and the local prompt history. The original files remain outside this repository.
- Inclusion boundary: from the `/clear` at 2026-09-24T12:06:05Z (start of Homework 3 Question 1 work) through the start of prompt 6. Nothing was reconstructed from recaps or repository history.
- Exclusions: all other local sessions were checked. None mention `agent-relay`. They cover Homework 1 and 2, including the session before the `/clear` (`98583f95-77f0-484b-8fe9-6d988e3d2f19`, same day, repository remote changes for Homework 1 and 2), so they are outside this record.

## Redactions and omissions

- `<HOME>` replaces the local Windows home-directory path in prompts, replies, commands and output. `<SCRATCHPAD>` and `<TASK_OUTPUT_DIR>` replace local temporary directories. These are the only changes to prompt wording.
- Harness `<pasted_content>` wrapper tags around pasted prompts are omitted (marked where they occur).

### Local command — 2026-09-24T12:06:05.312Z

````
/clear

### Prompt 1 — 2026-09-24T12:06:08.341Z

_Entered as a pasted-text block; the harness `<pasted_content>` wrapper tags are omitted._

````
Work on Homework 3 Question 1 only. Use my fork:
https://github.com/GerhardBalz/agent-relay

Check whether a local checkout already exists. If it does, inspect its remote, branch, and working tree before changing anything; do not overwrite local work. Otherwise clone the fork.

Read README.md and SPEC.md, verify that uv and the required Python version are available, install dependencies with `uv sync`, and start the application using the README command. Check `/health`, `/ready`, and the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Report the commands you ran, whether each check worked, the local URL, and any blocker. Keep the server running if practical. Do not run tests against the development database: the test fixture drops and recreates tables at `RELAY_DATABASE_URL`. Do not start Question 2, edit files, commit, push, or submit homework.

### Prompt 2 — 2026-09-24T12:18:06.901Z

````
Continue Homework 3 Question 1 in <HOME>\agent-relay. Inspect `git diff -- uv.lock` and confirm it contains only the four-line [options] removal caused by `uv sync`. If so, restore only uv.lock and report `git status --short`; preserve all other files and keep the server running.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a browser if your browser capability is available. Report what the dashboard actually displays. Do not register agents or start Question 2, run tests, commit, push, or submit homework. If browser access is unavailable, say so.

### Prompt 3 — 2026-09-24T12:25:56.023Z

````
commit
````

### Prompt 4 — 2026-09-24T12:26:19.075Z

````
In <HOME>\agent-relay, check the branch and working-tree status. Only if it is clean on main, run `git pull --ff-only origin main`. If it is dirty or cannot fast-forward, stop and report the details without discarding anything. Confirm that AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md are present, CLAUDE.md imports AGENTS.md, and report HEAD and final status. Keep the server running. Do not start Question 2 or change files.
````

### Prompt 5 — 2026-09-24T12:36:20.029Z

````
In <HOME>\agent-relay, inspect the branch, working-tree status, and origin fetch/push URLs. If origin still points to https://github.com/GerhardBalz/agent-relay.git, change only origin to https://github.com/GerhardBalz/adtz-03-agent-relay.git. Verify the new remote is reachable and report the final URLs, HEAD, and status. Preserve local files and keep the server running. Do not rename the local folder, start Question 2, or commit or push anything.
````

### Prompt 6 — 2026-09-24T12:37:41.604Z (PARTIAL — record-maintenance turn in progress)

_Entered as a pasted-text block; the harness `<pasted_content>` wrapper tags are omitted._

````
In <HOME>\agent-relay, follow AGENTS.md to create _docs/claude-code-prompts.md and _docs/claude-code-conversation.md from the original local Claude Code history and session transcripts. Include the Question 1 setup and dashboard inspection, including the session that began in my home directory. Preserve exact prompt wording; do not reconstruct missing material from recaps.

Use matching session coverage in both files. Label redactions, omissions, exclusions, and partial sessions. Keep original transcripts outside the public repository. Inspect the full staged content for credentials, tokens, personal information, and local paths. Add links to both files in README.md.

First check branch, remote, and working-tree status. If source coverage or safe publication is uncertain, stop and report the specific gap. Otherwise change only README.md and the two new _docs files, verify them, commit and push to https://github.com/GerhardBalz/adtz-03-agent-relay, and report the commit, coverage, redactions, omissions, and final status. Keep the server running. Do not start Question 2 or submit homework.
